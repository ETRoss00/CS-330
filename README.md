How do I approach designing software? What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft? What design process did you follow for your project work? How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?

Working on this project introduced me to designing 3D scenes and objects by breaking down complex real-world items into simpler geometric shapes like cubes, cylinders, and spheres. I learned to approach design by focusing on simplicity and modularity, which makes sure that each object is manageable and can be iteratively improved. The design process I followed involved planning the scene layout, determining object textures and materials, and creating light sources to enhance the visuals. For future projects, I can apply these tactics by first creating a clear plan and identifying reusable components, allowing for scalability and efficiency in design.

How do I approach developing programs? What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene? How did iteration factor into your development? How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?

Through this project, I used new development strategies, such as breaking tasks into milestones. Each milestone allowed me to focus on a specific feature whether it was modeling objects, adding textures, or implementing lighting. Iteration played a significant role. I tested and refined my work at each step, learning to debug shaders and adjust my code to achieve the desired outcomes. My approach to coding has evolved by incorporating structured workflows and using trial-and-error to solve problems like light attenuation and camera navigation. This method not only helped me complete the project but also prepared me to handle challenges in a methodical way in the future.

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals? How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway? How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?

This project highlighted the importance of computational graphics and visualization in areas like game development, virtual reality, and augmented reality. By learning how to create interactive 3D environments, I gained skills that could help me in future educational projects and professional roles that require immersive technology development. These skills are applicable to a range of fields, from creating engaging user interfaces to designing simulation tools for industries like automotive and aerospace. The ability to visualize and manipulate data in 3D environments will definitely open up opportunities in cutting-edge technology domains.
